## **Deployment & Local Development**
## Deplyment
This project was created by using Gitpod. I used the pre-built template from [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template).
The following commands were used:
* **git add .** - to add all the changes.
* **git commit -m "..."** - to commit all the changes to the local repository.
* **git push** - to push the committed changes to the GitHub repository.

### **Deployment to HerokuApp**
1. Create a list of requirements, commit and push to GitHub.
2. Create Account with Heroku.
3. On the Heroku Dashboard, select "create new app".
4. Give the app a name (it must be unique, as each app name can only exist once) and choose your current region.
5. Click "Create App".
6. On the "Settings" Tab, scroll to Config Vars.
7. Create a Config Var.
8. In the "KEY" field enter CREDS and for the "VALUE" field copy the creds.json link from your file and click "Add".
9. In the "KEY" field enter PORT and for the "VALUE" field enter 8000 and click "Add".
10. Add Buildpacks.
11. Choose the first one to be python and press "save".
12. Choose the second one to be nodejs and press "save".
13. Move to "Deploy" Tab.
