## [Bugs](#bugs)

### [Resolved Bugs](#resolvedbugs)

- Footer was visible while scrolling up and down the webpage. Taking off the class "footer-bottom" and passing it a margin and padding of 0 made the footer stick to the bottom of the webpage.
- When checking responsiveness iframe and get-in-touch container would overlap. To fix this issue I decreased the size of the iframe.

### [Unresolved Bugs](#unresolvedbugs)
- Navlinks should be active to show user which site they are currently on. I did not find out how to display this using bootstrap. 
- When displaying the existing bookings the name that appears on the booking is the actual username and not the name that was stated on the booking form.
- When asked to enter the date for the booking, also past dates are possible to be entered.
